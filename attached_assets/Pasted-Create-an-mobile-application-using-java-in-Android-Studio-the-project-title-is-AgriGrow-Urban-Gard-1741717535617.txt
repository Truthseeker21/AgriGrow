INTRODUCTION
Project Context

The global landscape is increasingly shaped by the dual challenges of urbanization and environmental sustainability. As populations concentrate in urban centers, the demand for food security and access to fresh, nutritious produce grows exponentially. Traditional agricultural practices, often located far from urban areas, contribute significantly to carbon emissions through transportation, packaging, and storage. Conventional farming methods can deplete soil resources, pollute waterways, and rely heavily on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.

In many regions, there is a growing awareness of the need for more localized and sustainable food systems. The increasing cost of living, coupled with concerns about food safety and environmental impact, has fueled a surge of interest in urban gardening and small-scale farming. However, many individuals lack the knowledge, skills, and resources necessary to successfully cultivate food in urban environments. Limited access to land, lack of gardening experience, and unfamiliarity with sustainable practices often present significant barriers to entry.

Local communities are beginning to recognize the potential of urban agriculture to address these challenges. Community gardens, rooftop farms, and vertical gardening initiatives are emerging as innovative solutions to increase food production, enhance community resilience, and promote environmental stewardship. These efforts often operate in isolation, lacking access to comprehensive information, expert guidance, and a supportive network of fellow gardeners.

Based on observations of urban communities, it is evident that there is a growing need for readily accessible, practical information and support for urban gardening and sustainable farming practices. Many well-intentioned individuals are eager to grow their own food but struggle to navigate the complexities of urban agriculture. This challenge represents a significant opportunity to leverage technology to empower individuals and communities to create more sustainable and resilient food systems.

The rationale for this study stems directly from the observed gap between the growing interest in urban gardening and the lack of accessible resources to support successful implementation. This leads to the proposed research problem.

Purpose and Description

AgriGrow is a mobile application designed to guide urban dwellers and small-scale farmers in practicing sustainable gardening and farming techniques within limited spaces. The app provides step-by-step guides, planting schedules, eco-friendly farming methods, and urban gardening tips to promote self-sufficiency and environmental sustainability.

The platform serves as an educational and interactive tool, offering users customized gardening plans, organic composting methods, and pest control solutions using natural alternatives. It also includes a community forum where users can exchange ideas, seek advice, and connect with other urban gardeners and eco-farmers. AgriGrow aims to empower individuals and communities to cultivate their own food, reduce reliance on industrial agriculture, and contribute to a more sustainable and resilient food system. The uniqueness of AgriGrow lies in its comprehensive approach, combining practical gardening advice with community-building features and a focus on sustainable practices.

Scope of the project
Key Features: 
oTo Develop a step-by-step guides on various urban gardening techniques (container gardening, vertical gardening, etc.).
Step-by-step guides with visuals would be incredibly helpful, especially for beginners. Clear instructions on techniques like container and vertical gardening would make urban gardening more accessible, empowering users to confidently maximize their space.
oTo develop a personalized planting schedules based on location and climate.
Personalized planting schedules are invaluable for gardeners. By considering the specific location and climate, the app can provide tailored advice on when to sow seeds, transplant seedlings, and harvest crops, leading to greater gardening success.
oTo develop a information on organic composting and natural pest control.
With the providing information on organic composting helps users create nutrient-rich soil from kitchen scraps and yard waste, reducing waste and promoting healthy plant growth. Additionally, guidance on natural pest control methods minimizes the use of harmful chemicals, ensuring a safe and eco-friendly approach to gardening.
oTo develop community forum for user interaction and knowledge sharing.
With a community forum is a fantastic way to foster a sense of shared learning and support among urban gardeners. Users could exchange tips, ask questions, and learn from each other's experiences, creating a thriving online community passionate about urban gardening. This would not only enhance the user experience but also contribute to a richer knowledge base for all.
oTo develop educational resources on sustainable farming practices.
Integrating educational resources on sustainable practices like composting, water conservation, and natural pest control would enable users to minimize their environmental impact. By incorporating these methods, urban gardens can become not only sources of fresh produce but also contribute to a healthier city.



oTo develop information on appropriate plant selection for urban environments.
Providing information on suitable plants, like compact varieties or those tolerant of shade and pollution, will help users choose the best options for their specific urban setting. This ensures they can grow thriving plants and enjoy the benefits of urban gardening.
Focus: 
oPromoting sustainable and eco-friendly urban agriculture.
oEnhancing food security and self-sufficiency in urban areas.
oBuilding a community of urban gardeners and farmers.
